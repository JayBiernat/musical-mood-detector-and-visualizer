This program monitors audio and predicts the mood of the input (assumed
to be music) using two values: valence (how pleasurable the musical
mood is) and arousal (how energized the musical mood is).  These two
values are then used to manipulate the saturation and brightness of an
image to visualize the current musical mood.
